To change the dataset GPT-2 models will fine-tune on, change this URL to another .txt file, and change corresponding part of the next cell. Note that you can use small datasets if you want but you will have to be sure not to run the fine-tuning for too long or you will overfit badly. Roughly, expect interesting results within minutes to hours in the 1-10s of megabyte ballpark, and below this you may want to stop the run early as fine-tuning can be very fast."
